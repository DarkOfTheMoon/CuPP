NOTE:
Be sure you start with a clean checkout ~ there are no CMake cache files floating arround.


BUILD:
1. Change into directory "Build"
2. Call "cmake ." or "ccmake ." to generator the build script
3. Build using your local build toll (eg. call make)

You will find the CuPP library in "Build/lib" and the examples in "Build/examples"
